          <h2 class="section-heading">The Genesis</h2>
              <p class="content">
                NIRB, had its origin in the National Centre for Management Development
                in Agriculture and Rural Development Banking (NCMDARDB), which was
                promoted by the National Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development
                Banks' Federation (NCARDBF) in 1990 and registered as a Public Trust.
                The initiative for this venture of national importance was taken by
                two visionaries in the field of cooperative movement viz., Sarvashri
                B.S.Vishwanathan and P.V.Prabhu, the then Chairman and the Executive
                Director respectively, of NCARDBF, Mumbai. Though an initial
                contribution of Rs.10 lakh was made by NCARDBF, major funding support
                for the initial six years came from the Rabobank Foundation of
                Rabobank, the Netherlands. Rabobank is a leading Cooperative Bank in
                the world founded on Raiffeisen principles and ideals. Since 1996-97
                NIRB has been functioning on self-supporting basis.

              <p class="content">
                In the year 2004, nomenclature of NCMDARDB was changed to National
                Institute for Rural Banking (NIRB) with a view to bringing about the
                required focus on the thrust areas of the training imparted by it and
                incidentally to make it more meaningful.

        <h2>The Genesis</h2>
        <p class="content">
          NIRB, had its origin in the National Centre for Management Development
          in Agriculture and Rural Development Banking (NCMDARDB), which was
          promoted by the National Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development
          Banks' Federation (NCARDBF) in 1990 and registered as a Public Trust.
          The initiative for this venture of national importance was taken by
          two visionaries in the field of cooperative movement viz., Sarvashri
          B.S.Vishwanathan and P.V.Prabhu, the then Chairman and the Executive
          Director respectively, of NCARDBF, Mumbai. Though an initial
          contribution of Rs.10 lakh was made by NCARDBF, major funding support
          for the initial six years came from the Rabobank Foundation of
          Rabobank, the Netherlands. Rabobank is a leading Cooperative Bank in
          the world founded on Raiffeisen principles and ideals. Since 1996-97
          NIRB has been functioning on self-supporting basis.

        <h2>The Renaming</h2>
        <p class="content">
          In the year 2004, nomenclature of NCMDARDB was changed to National
          Institute for Rural Banking (NIRB) with a view to bringing about the
          required focus on the thrust areas of the training imparted by it and
          incidentally to make it more meaningful.
